                <h2>Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Amartya Sen is one of the 21st century’s prominent economists and thinkers; he has had his books translated into over 30
                    languages and received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1998 <cite>Harvard University, 2015; Nobel Prize, 2015</cite>.
                    He has written many papers and delivered many lectures on the topic of development over the past 40 years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Sen, the field of ‘development’ first received serious thought and investigation shortly after WWII, with emphasis
                    specifically on economic growth <cite>Sen, 1997</cite>. Traditionally, development
                    has been measured as “the growth of GNP [gross national product] per head”, regardless of how this growth
                    may be achieved. He seeks to move beyond this traditional measure by advocating instead for the expansion
                    of human capabilities and freedom as the end goal of development <cite>Sen, 1997</cite>. When contemplating
                    and planning development, ultimately there must be concern for how people will be affected; development
                    cannot simply be viewed in terms of the advancement of lifeless objects of utility (e.g. raising the
                    GNP or personal incomes) <cite>Sen, 2005, p. 1971</cite>. The following quote sums up nicely how Sen
                    would like to define development:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    If development is seen, ultimately, as the expansion of the capability of people to do the things they have reason to value
                    and choose, the glorification of human beings as “instruments” of economic development cannot really
                    be adequate.
                    <cite>Sen, 1997</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    When compared to the traditional way of thinking, this view makes a lot of sense, as exchange value– typical of how markets
                    operate –cannot be used for interpersonal comparison. This can easily be demonstrated by comparing two
                    individuals with the same means who may not value the same ends. Given the differences that exist amongst
                    people (e.g. age, illness, disability, etc.), it is likely that two individuals of equal means (i.e.
                    wealth) may not only value different ends, but they will also not have the same opportunities <cite>Sen, 1997</cite>.

                <h2>Key Analytical Approaches</h2>
                <p>
                    Though GNP is no longer seen as representative of the level of development achieved under this new definition, it still remains
                    an important factor in how we analyze the overall effects of development. As a replacement, GNP becomes
                    but one of many indicators that we may use to measure human wellbeing through something called the “capability
                    approach,” which “sees human life as a set of “doings and beings” –we may call them “functionings” –and
                    it relates the evaluation of the quality of life to the assessment of the capability to function” <cite>Sen,
                    1990, p. 43</cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Sen proposes a wide range of “instruments” (indicators) that can be used simultaneously to encourage and measure development.
                    The use of both social (state planning) and economic (free markets) strategies and ideas are proposed,
                    and Sen suggests there must be a fine balance between the two as opposed to an all-or-nothing approach.
                    Regarding these instruments, Sen writes the following:
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    The range of instruments has to cover, on the one hand, education, health care, building of infrastructure and land reforms,
                    and on the other, intelligent use of domestic and global markets (rather than treating globalisation
                    as some kind of gigantic ‘Jaws’ that would gobble up the world). And, no less importantly, the range
                    of instruments has to go well beyond the ground covered by the two lessons taken together [specifically
                    regarding China’s pre-1979 socialist planning and post-1979 market reform]. There is, in particular,
                    the important contribution of democracy and the need to strengthen further our democratic practice.
                    <cite>Sen, 2005, p. 1973</cite>

                <h2>Opinions/Critiques of International Development</h2>
                <p>
                    Sen believes that the narrow focus on the accumulation of real income and economic growth (typical success indicators of
                    traditional development) leads to the view that humans are simply a means to an end, and not seen as
                    ends in and of themselves <cite>1990</cite>. Rather, he postulates that humans should
                    be viewed as both means and ends, with a greater emphasis on ‘ends’. As he makes clear, economic prosperity
                    is not linked one-to-one with enriching the lives of people; at best it is but one of many means that
                    may do so and that simply enhancing the economic richness of individuals can be quite ineffective in
                    the pursuit of really valuable ends <cite>Sen, 1990</cite>.
                </p>

                    the pursuit of really valuable ends <cite>Sen, 1990</cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The segregation of people into categories via some allegedly all-encompassing and authoritative classification system is
                    something to be viewed with great skepticism. We should refrain from classifying individuals as members
                    of various civilizations (e.g. the Western world, Islamic world, etc.) as this leads to war and forms
                    the basis for how people can do harm to ‘others’ <cite>Sen, 2010, p. 6997</cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Another point to focus on is that development takes place on a ‘world scale’ and is not limited to regions or cultures. This
                    can be illustrated by pointing out that the Chinese first contributed many of the innovations that have
                    led to the rise of ‘Western culture’, and we don’t refer to these innovations as Chinese ways of doing
                    things. Instead, these innovations (e.g. gunpowder, printing, etc.) are viewed as contributions to the
                    development of world civilization in general <cite>Sen, 2010, p. 6998</cite>. People
                    adopt and assimilate products and innovations that we understand and enjoy, regardless of who was responsible
                    for their origination
                    <cite>Sen, 2010, p. 6998</cite>. When it comes to international development, the free market does not
                    discriminate based on where innovation comes from.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While the market alone can work to promote development, there is still good reason not to abandon the role of the state in
                    many facets of social planning, specifically in regard to health care and education <cite>Sen, 1997</cite>.
                    Governments are often portrayed as too active in social planning matters (e.g. too much control in industries,
                    hampering competition, etc.), but sometimes they are not active enough (e.g. not expanding education
                    and health care, lack of gender equality promotion, etc.), again here there needs to be a balance.
                </p>
                <blockquote>
                    Is there really a conflict between civil and political rights on one hand and economic development on the other? […] Systematic
                    statistical studies give no real support to the claim that there is a general conflict between political
                    rights and economic performance
                    <cite>Sen, 1997</cite>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Civil rights in fact have a favourable effect on development, which contrasts with the ‘Lee hypothesis’ that there is generally
                    a negative relation between the two <cite>Sen, 1997</cite>.

                <h2>Prescriptive Suggestions and Goals</h2>
                <p>
                    Sen is an ardent believer that education can be used to evaluate just about anything. He offers four things– in regard to
                    development –which education can do:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        More education can help productivity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The sharing of educational improvements allows for greater distribution of national income amongst the people
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Those who are better educated will have greater chances of converting incomes and resources into an assortment of ways of
                        life
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Education further enables people to choose intelligently from amongst the various ways a person may live
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    “All these distinct influences can have important bearings on the development of valuable capabilities and thus on the process
                    of human development” <cite>Sen, 1990</cite>. The emphasis here is on human development,
                    and not on development of the Third World or the Global South, or any other systematic categorization
                    of the world’s populace.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We need to abandon the classifications of people by civilization as it only serves to provide us with an incomplete history
                    and to divide us against ourselves. “It makes people’s cultural backgrounds look more unbridgeable [sic]
                    distant than they in fact are, and it encourages separatist and possibly confrontational views of each
                    other” <cite>Sen, 2010, p. 6999</cite>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “The basic issue is not so much whether we end up having a high rate of economic growth (important as it undoubtedly is –
                    through its causal connections), but what that growth – along with everything else happening in the economy
                    – does for the people involved” <cite>Sen, 2005, p. 1971</cite>. What must always
                    be considered when planning economic reform is the affect any changes will have on those who are the
                    most marginalized in our society.
