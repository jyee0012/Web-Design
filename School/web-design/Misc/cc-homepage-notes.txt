1. The nav is confusing and too clustered along with log in and sign up which I believe do not belong, so I spaced out the nav and moved the login and sign up elsewhere.

2. The active nav color is too close to the neutral color, so I changed it to orange where it stands out more.

3. The site doesn't really explain what it is at first glance, so I moved the welcome text further up above the image to greet new users with the short description of what the site is for.

4. The labels inside the text boxes may be unreliable, so I recreated the labels to be sligtly above the text boxes and spaced out the text boxes some more.

5. Social media shouldn't be the first thing the users see but the site's name or logo, so I moved the social media to the footer and placed the title/logo at the top left.
