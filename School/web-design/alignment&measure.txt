alignment is lining text up so it is easily readable and not confusing to the human eye. 
Avoid justified alignment, and avoid using center alignment when using a large wall of text.
margins are used in alignment to ensure that they all start along the same line.

measure is the length of how a line of text may extend to. ensuring that the single line of text isn't too long so the users will get lost. 
Instead break the lines down to be shorter and easier to manage. 
size of text may also affect measurement, because that was all I could find when searching things up.
